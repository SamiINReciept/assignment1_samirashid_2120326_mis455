        <div class="card-description">As a student enrolled in my university's course on artificial intelligence (CSE425), I am privileged to delve into the dynamic world of AI. This comprehensive program equips us with a diverse array of skills and knowledge, ranging from fundamental machine learning algorithms to advanced search methodologies such as A* search and LCFS search. Delving deeper, we explore crucial concepts like heuristic functions, laying a solid foundation for understanding the complexities of AI. Additionally, the curriculum offers a glimpse into cutting-edge topics such as machine learning and deep learning, providing invaluable insights into the forefront of technological innovation. </div>

            <div class="image-description"><b>Graph Coloring Problem - </b>The objective of graph coloring problem is to assign colors to the nodes of a graph in a way that no two adjacent nodes share the same color. Applications lie in various domains such as scheduling, map coloring, and register allocation in compiler design.</div>

            <div class="image-description"><b>A* search and Heuristic function - </b>A* search intelligently combines the benefits of Dijkstra's algorithm with a heuristic function to efficiently find the shortest path from a starting node to a goal node in a weighted graph. The heuristic function provides an estimate of the remaining cost from the current node to the goal, guiding the search towards the most promising paths first</d>
