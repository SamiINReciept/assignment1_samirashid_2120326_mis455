        <div class="card-description">From immersive needfinding techniques to robust user evaluation methods and insightful data analysis approaches, the course (CSE490-HCI) has equipped me with a diverse toolkit for crafting intuitive interfaces. Moreover, our hands-on project in HCI has been a transformative experience. Focused on addressing stress management challenges among healthcare providers in Bangladesh, this project not only underscores the practical relevance of HCI principles but also serves as the cornerstone of my undergraduate thesis. As we continue to refine and develop this initiative, I'm excited to contribute meaningfully to both academia and real-world problem-solving.</div>
